## Introduction

A popular way for people to find housing when visiting a different city than their own is by using Airbnb. Airbnb is a marketplace that allows users to rent housing accommodations from hosts on the platform. Airbnbs can be found in nearly every city, in this project we will be looking at the listings in Las Vegas and conducting an EDA on the dataset. The dataset for this project was sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kanchana1990/airbnb-las-vegas-listings)
